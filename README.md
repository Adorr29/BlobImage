# BlobImage

A little game in which you have to spawn blobs so that they can reconstruct an image.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ReadmeResources/Blob presentation.png" alt="Blob presentation">
</div>

Press `F1` to display available shortcut.

You can choose your image by changing the image in <a href="https://github.com/Adorr29/BlobImage/blob/main/Assets/StreamingAssets">StreamingAssets</a> by following these rules :
- The image **must** be in .png format
- Prefer use low resolution image
- There will be no blobs on the transparent pixel
- You can change the background color by adding a hex color to your file name *(ex: "MyImage<b>#FF0000</b>.png" to have your image on a red background)*
